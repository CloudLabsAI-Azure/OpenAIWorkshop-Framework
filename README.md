## What You Can Do With This Workshop  
  
- **Design and prototype agent solutions** for real-world business scenarios.  
- **Compare single-agent vs. multi-agent** architectures and approaches.  
- **Develop and contrast agent implementations** using different platforms:  
  - **[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework)** (NEW!) - Microsoft's latest agentic AI framework with advanced multi-agent orchestration (Magentic workflows, handoffs, checkpointing)  
  - Azure AI Agent Service  
  - Semantic Kernel  
  - Autogen

## Key Features  
  
- **üéØ Microsoft Agent Framework Support (NEW!):** Full integration with [Microsoft's Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) featuring:
  - **Now available via pip!** Install with: `pip install agent-framework` or `uv add agent-framework`
  - **Single-agent** with MCP tools and streaming token-by-token responses
  - **Multi-agent Magentic orchestration** with intelligent task delegation and progress tracking
  - **Handoff-based multi-domain agents** for specialized task routing with smart context transfer
  - **Checkpointing and resumable workflows** for long-running agentic tasks
  - **Real-time WebSocket streaming** with internal agent process visibility
  - üìö **[See detailed pattern guide and documentation ‚Üí](agentic_ai/agents/agent_framework/README.md)**
  
- **üñ•Ô∏è Advanced UI Options:**  
  - **React Frontend:** Real-time streaming visualization with agent internal processes, tool calls, orchestrator planning, and turn-by-turn history tracking
  - **Streamlit Frontend:** Simple, elegant chat interface for quick prototyping and demos
  
- **Configurable LLM Backend:** Use the latest Azure OpenAI GPT models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o).  
- **MCP Server Integration:** Advanced tools to enhance agent orchestration and capabilities with Model Context Protocol.  
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol Support:** Enables strict cross-domain, black-box multi-agent collaboration using [Google's A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A). [Learn more &rarr;](agentic_ai/agents/semantic_kernel/multi_agent/a2a).  
- **Durable Agent Pattern:** Includes a demo of a robust agent that persists its state, survives restarts, and manages long-running workflows. [Learn more &rarr;](agentic_ai/scenarios/durable_agent/README.md)  
- **Flexible Agent Architecture:**  
  - Supports single-agent, multi-agent, or reflection-based agents (selectable via `.env`).  
  - Agents can self-loop, collaborate, reflect, or take on dynamic roles as defined in modules.  
  - Multiple frameworks: Agent Framework, Autogen, Semantic Kernel, Azure AI Agent Service.  
- **Session-Based Chat:** Persistent conversation history for each session.  
- **Full-Stack Application:**  
  - FastAPI backend with WebSocket and RESTful endpoints (chat, reset, history, etc.).  
  - Choice of frontend: React (advanced streaming visualization) or Streamlit (simple chat).  
- **Environment-Based Configuration:** Easily configure the system using `.env` files.

## Getting Started  
  
1. Review the [Setup Instructions](./SETUP.md) for environment prerequisites and step-by-step installation.  
2. Explore the [Business Scenario and Agent Design](./SCENARIO.md) to understand the workshop challenge.  
3. Check out the **[Agent Framework Implementation Patterns](agentic_ai/agents/agent_framework/README.md)** to choose the right multi-agent approach (single-agent, Magentic orchestration, or handoff pattern).
4. Dive into [System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) before building and customizing your agent solutions.  
5. Explore **[Workflow Examples & Production Demos](agentic_ai/workflow/)** to learn advanced orchestration patterns.
6. Utilize the [Support Guide](./SUPPORT.md) for troubleshooting and assistance.

## Workflow Orchestration  
  
The workshop includes comprehensive **workflow orchestration** capabilities built on the Microsoft Agent Framework's Pregel-style execution engine. Workflows enable complex multi-agent coordination with type-safe messaging, checkpointing, and real-time observability.  
  
### üéØ Featured Demo: Fraud Detection System  
  
A production-ready fraud detection workflow showcasing enterprise-grade patterns:  
  
- **Real-time React dashboard** with live workflow visualization  
- **Fan-out/fan-in patterns** for parallel specialist agent analysis  
- **Human-in-the-loop** analyst review with checkpointing  
- **MCP tool integration** for customer data access  
- **WebSocket streaming** for live event updates
