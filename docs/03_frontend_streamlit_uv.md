## Streamlit Frontend (Simple & Fast) ðŸš€
The common backend application runs the agent selected in the .env file and connects to the frontend UI.

The Streamlit frontend provides a **clean, simple chat interface** ideal for:
- Quick prototyping and demos
- Simple interaction without streaming visualization
- All agent types (Autogen, Semantic Kernel, Agent Framework)


**Terminal - Start Streamlit:**

```bash  
cd agentic_ai/applications
uv run streamlit run frontend.py  
```
The backend and frontend are running and hosted at:
- Backend: [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000)
- Streamlit: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

Navigate to the Streamlit URL in your browser to interact with the agent.

---

If you successfully completed all the steps, setup is complete and your agent should be running now!
